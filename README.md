## Technical Details

2. Each digit is subtracted from 10 (with 0 remaining 0)
3. The resulting number is compared with the input to determine winning status

### File Structure
- Single HTML file containing all necessary code
- Inline CSS for styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for functionality
- No external dependencies except Font Awesome (loaded via CDN)

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
